Repository containing all Big Data &amp; Analytics Association workshop code.

Over the years, BDAA has given countless workshops on a diverse set of analytics topics, from Intro to AWS to Web Scraping with Python. Because these workshops were specifically designed for students, we have made all workshop content, code, and exercises available in this repository. As more workshops are developed, they will be added to this repository.
